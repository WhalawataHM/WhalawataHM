Welcome to my little corner of the internet — **WhalawataHM**'s GitHub profile!  
Yes, that's me, the human behind the keyboard (and occasionally a confused expression when my code doesn't work).

### ⚡ Fun Facts:
- My debugging style: `printf("is this working?");`
- If I had a dollar for every time I fixed a bug by turning it off and on again, I'd own a private island.
- Believe it or not — I once coded for 6 hours straight without realizing my coffee cup was empty. **A true tragedy.**
